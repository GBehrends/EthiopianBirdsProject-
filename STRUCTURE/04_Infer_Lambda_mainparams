# When placing this in your directory be sure to name it mainparams so STRUCTURE will recognize it.
# The INfer_Lambda.sh will change the infile, outfile, numinds, numloci, and the starting seed to a random number between reps. 
# I included POPDATA and LOCDATA in my analysis for use in the LOCPRIOR model to detect subtle structure between relatively undifferentiated populations.
