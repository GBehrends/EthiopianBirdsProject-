## A pipeline to generate gene trees using RAxML by specified windows of the reference assembly, and then generate species trees using DendroPy and ASTRAL III. 

# 01_Run_RAxML.r
An R script for generating a template shell submission script to run RAxML on your windows. Script adapted from https://github.com/jdmanthey/certhia_phylogeography. There should be a new directory formed with an sh script to run in it
and a few helper files. 

# Use these file to help generate the windowed trees provided by Dr Joseph Manthey @ 
https://github.com/jdmanthey/certhia_phylogeography. YOu will need to modify the windowstat calculations 
script to whatever window size you are working with. You will also need to modify the create_fasta.r 
script to specify a minimum amount of missing sites for a fasta to still be created. 

window_stat_calculations.r 
create_fasta.r
create_fasta_from_vcf.r
calculate_windows.r


# Now create popmaps in the following fashion (tab delimited): 
Individual	Number	PopName
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB013	1	Bale_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB049	2	Menagesha
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB050	3	Menagesha
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB051	4	Menagesha
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB065	5	Bale_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB081	6	Choke_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB089	7	Choke_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB090	8	Choke_Mountains

# Put these popmap files into the directory generated by 01_Run_RAxML.r. 

# 02_Chrom_ConcatSort.sh
Use this script to prepare VCFs that were split through the previous genotyping step in this project. Chromosomes that are split will vary between 
studies so you will have to figure out which ones they were. 


# 03_FiltZip.sh
Use this script to filter gVCFs to include invariant and variant sites for the gene trees. Also, this script will split group genotypeed VCFs 
# into VCFs by species or whatever samples are included in a "keeplist". An exampel fo the keeplist is provided. The script will bgzip and tabix
the files in order to simplify the job of calling windows later. 


# Open an interactive session


# Run the following in the directory containing your output trees to get the amount of trees that were 
kept (Save this to an excel sheet for further reporting):
l | grep "RAxML_bipartitions." | wc -l


# Combine gene trees into one .trees file 
cat RAxML_bipartitions.* >> <species>.trees


# Create maximum clade credibility trees with summary of bootstrap support with the sumtrees.py script from DendroPy
# --min-clade-freq option is used to only include clades supported by more than 5% of bootstraps
sumtrees.py --output=<species>.tre --min-clade-freq=0.05 <species>.trees 


# Create ASTRAL III species trees
java -jar <Path>/Astral/astral.5.7.8.jar -i <species>.trees -o <species>_Astral.tre


# Any program able to recognize Nexus format files can now be used for visualization

# 04_Modify_Lengths.r 
Branch lengths in ASTRAL species trees are not informative. This script modifies those lengths to that desired, and plots 
the trees.
