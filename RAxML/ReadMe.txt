## A pipeline to generate gene trees using RAxML by specified windows of the reference assembly, and then generate species 
# trees using DendroPy and ASTRAL III. 

# 01_Run_RAxML.r
An R script for generating a template shell submission script to run RAxML on your genome windows. Script adapted from https://github.com/jdmanthey/certhia_phylogeography. There should be a new directory formed with an sh script to run in it
and a few helper files. 

# Use these file to help generate the windowed trees provided by Dr Joseph Manthey @ 
https://github.com/jdmanthey/certhia_phylogeography. YOu will need to modify the windowstat calculations 
script to whatever window size you are working with. You will also need to modify the create_fasta.r 
script to specify a minimum amount of missing sites for a fasta to still be created. 

window_stat_calculations.r 
create_fasta.r
create_fasta_from_vcf.r
calculate_windows.r


# Now create popmaps in the following fashion (tab delimited): 
Individual	Number	PopName
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB013	1	Bale_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB049	2	Menagesha
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB050	3	Menagesha
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB051	4	Menagesha
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB065	5	Bale_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB081	6	Choke_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB089	7	Choke_Mountains
Zosterops_poliogastrus_EB090	8	Choke_Mountains

# Put these popmap files into the directory generated by 01_Run_RAxML.r. 

# 02_Chrom_ConcatSort.sh
Use this script to prepare VCFs that were split through the previous genotyping step in this project. Chromosomes that are 
split will vary between 
studies so you will have to figure out which ones they were. 


# 03_FiltZip.sh
Use this script to filter gVCFs to include invariant and variant sites for the gene trees. Also, this script will split 
group genotypeed VCFs into VCFs by species or whatever samples are included in a "keeplist". An example fo the keeplist is 
provided. The script will bgzip and tabix the files in order to simplify the job of calling windows later. 

# Make sure there is a "windows" directory in the directory that was created in the first step. Now you will run the outputted sh script. Be sure 
that you added the sed command outlined in it so that RAxML will actually run. 

# Now there should be RAxML windowed gene trees in the windows folder.
